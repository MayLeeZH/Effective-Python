# Effective-Python

This is a record of my study of "Effective Python". I've selected parts of the book that I consider important and have stored them in the form of an IPython Notebook (.ipynb) for easy code execution. If you want to quickly learn from this book, you can refer to my notes. I want to emphasize again that this is just a record of my study of the book and not my own innovation.

这是我学习effective python的记录，我讲书籍中我认为重要的部分选出，并用ipynb的形式存储，方便代码运行。如果你想快速学习这本书，可以参考我的记录。
